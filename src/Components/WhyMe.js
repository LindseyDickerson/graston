            <p id="myWhy">Every time I hear more about Graston, it makes me more excited about the position. When I visited the office the other day I observed people who work well together and come together. I like that this role will work closely with a Seinor Developer along with DeveloperTown. I'm not going to lie, it's also nice for you to be on the north side of town! I can only hope that if I were to be in this role I would learn quite a lot, which is very exciting.</p>
